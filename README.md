This project is a simple, educational decryptor written entirely in **x86 Assembly**, designed to reverse XOR-encrypted files using raw **Linux system calls**.

> ‚úÖ This project contains **only** decryption logic. There is **no encryption**, ransomware, or malicious behavior present.

## üß† Purpose
To demonstrate low-level systems programming:
- Linux syscalls: `open`, `read`, `lseek`, `write`, `close`
- Manual file buffer handling
- Symmetric XOR-based decryption
- Register and memory manipulation using NASM

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
In the video, the program targets a specific file, `victim.txt`, encrypts it using XOR (`0xAA`), and restores the original contents. However, I have only released the decryptor code on this GitHub.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool was created strictly for educational and research purposes. It is not intended for malicious use.
