# üîê Assembly XOR File Decryptor (Linux, x86)

This project is a simple, educational decryptor written entirely in **x86 Assembly**, designed to reverse XOR-encrypted files using raw **Linux system calls**. In the video, I run the encryptor in a simulated environment (Kali Linux).

> ‚úÖ This project contains **only** decryption logic. There is **no encryption**, ransomware, or malicious behavior present.

## üß† Purpose
To demonstrate low-level systems programming:
- Linux syscalls: `open`, `read`, `lseek`, `write`, `close`
- Manual file buffer handling
- Symmetric XOR-based decryption
- Register and memory manipulation using NASM


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool was created strictly for educational and research purposes. It is not intended for malicious use.
